# nw-gtk

A couple of React components for using GTK HeaderBars in NW.js
with [postcss-gtk](https://github.com/1j01/postcss-gtk)

To be extracted from and used by
[Audio Editor](http://github.com/1j01/audio-editor)
and
[Project Nexus](http://github.com/1j01/project-nexus)

Ideally, though, we'd use actual headerbars in NW.js on supporting platforms.
